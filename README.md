## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

- **Frontend Layer**: Web-based chat interface for user interaction  
- **Application Layer**: Rasa NLU and dialogue management for intent handling  
- **Data Layer**: SQLite database storing student records and university data  

The chatbot processes user input, maps it to predefined intents, and retrieves relevant information from the database to generate accurate responses.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User submits a query through the web interface  
2. NLP engine processes the query using trained Rasa models  
3. Intent classification and dialogue policies determine the response  
4. Backend fetches relevant data from the database  
5. Response is displayed in real time
